The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console when the code is executed, and they will appear in the following order:  
console.log(1); -> Output: 1 The number 1 will be logged first, as it is executed synchronously when the function is invoked.  
console.log(4); -> Output: 4 The number 4 will be logged second, also because it is executed synchronously after the first console.log(1);.
setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0); The number 3 will be logged third, despite the setTimeout delay being set to 0 milliseconds. 
Although it seems like it should be logged immediately, setTimeout is an asynchronous function and is placed in the event loop. 
Even with a 0-millisecond delay, it will be executed after the current synchronous code finishes.  setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000); 
The number 2 will be logged last. This setTimeout has a delay of 1000 milliseconds, so it will be executed after the previous logs and after a 1000-millisecond delay. 
Hence, the number 2 will appear last in the console.
