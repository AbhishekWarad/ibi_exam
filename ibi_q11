const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, { evens: [], odds: [] }); // Provide an initial value as an empty object

console.log(result);

output - { evens: [2, 4], odds: [1, 3, 5] }

#explaination - The code uses the reduce() method to loop through the numbers array and separate even and odd numbers into the evens and odds properties of the accumulator (acc).
#The initial value of the accumulator is set to { evens: [], odds: [] }.
